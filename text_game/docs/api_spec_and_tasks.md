## Shared Knowledge:

```python
"""
The 'game.py' file contains the main game logic, including starting and ending the game, updating the score, moving the player, checking for collisions, and rendering the game screen.

The 'player.py' file contains the Player class, which represents the player in the game. It has methods for moving the player left, right, and jumping.

The 'item.py' file contains the Item class, which represents the items in the game. It has a method for getting the position of the item.

The 'ascii_art_generator.py' file contains the AsciiArtGenerator class, which generates ASCII art for game elements. It has a method for generating ASCII art based on a given symbol.
